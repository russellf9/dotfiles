# dotfiles
An organised set of `dot` files for configuration


## Description

Looking at learning on how to set up a fast way to set up a new computer with a saved configuration.

I've created a structure like [Getting Started With Dotfiles](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789)

I'm still working on setting up commands to fullu automate the task.

## Installation


```
cd ~

git checkout https://github.com/russellf9/dotfiles.git

cd dotfile

sh install.sh

cd ~/install

sh brew.sh


```
